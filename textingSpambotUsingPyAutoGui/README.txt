                                                                    ****SHaiP AntiScamService****
To text the scammer repeatedly(or maybe, infinitely), just get the file SHaiP.py running by following these steps:

Step-1) First of all, install python3 and PyAutoGui to your machine.

Step-2) Go to the directory where you have stored SHaiP.py. Then, open that directory in Command prompt(For Windows users) or Terminal(For Linux and Mac users)

Step-3) In the command prompt or terminal, just type python3 SHaiP.py. 

Step-4) Type the message that you want to send the scammer infinitely.Now just sit back and relax :)

NOTE: AS SOON AS YOU FOLLOW STEP:4, THE PROGRAM WILL BEGIN TO ENTER SENTENCES WHEREVER YOU PUT YOUR CURSOR WITHIN 10 SECONDS. TO STOP THIS SERVICE, YOU CAN JUST KILL THE TERMINAL PROCESS.

IMPORTTANT: THIS IS NOT TESTED WITH A WINDOWS MACHINE. SO, I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR MACHINE TO BECOME UNUSABLE(TEMPORARILY) AFTER FOLLOWING STEP-3.

PLEASE DON'T USE IT FOR UNFAIR USES.
